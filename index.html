							<p>
								I'm currently a third year English and Professional Writing student at York University.
								This website functions as a portfolio for work I completed throughout the Winter 2020/2021 course,
								<i>WRIT3001 Intermediate Digital Authoring</i>. The first project was a sonic essay, where I speak about my
								experiences in digital authoring using audio cues. The second project was a video essay, where I explored the
								same theme by using visual cues, illustrating how I have used different tools in my digital authoring practices.

									For this project, I narrated my earliest experiences in digital authoring, and used musical interludes to signify
									both mood and changes of topic. It was a chance to explore how text and sound can be used to tell a story.

<b>(00:00 – Music introduction, “Lahaina” from Blue Dot Sessions)<br><br>
(00:10)</b><br>
Hi, my name is Kelsey and today I will be talking about some of my earliest experiences in digital authoring to the more recent
ones and what I’ve learned from them.<br><br><br>
<b>(00:18 Music interlude 1)<br><br><br>
(00:25)</b><br>
The first social media account I ever made was my YouTube account, which I made a long time ago. Because of this,
I’ve seen YouTube change a lot throughout the years and have come to see how it has become more restrictive, while at the
same time becoming more popular, and consisting of a variety of different forms of entertainment.<br><br>
<b>(00:41 Music interlude 2, “Bossa Boa” from Blue Dot Sessions)<br><br>
(00:43)</b><br>
From what I can remember, YouTube was originally created as a website to watch videos and TV. People were able to watch
 entire anime series, as well as music videos uploaded by fans that were not met with copyright restrictions. I even once
 uploaded an MTV special of a band I liked, only to have the video removed months later as it violated copyright.<br><br>
<b>(1:03 “Glass Smashing Bottles” from Freesound.org)<br><br>
(1:05)</b><br>
A lot of the changes came after YouTube was bought by Google. When I tried to upload videos of a concert I went to, I was
eventually met with the same restrictions, and while it was fun to interact with other fans, all good things must come to an end.
<br><br>
<b>(1:18 Music interlude 3, “Trois Gnossiennes 3” from Blue Dot Sessions)
(1:25)</b><br>
Around this time, Blogger was also very popular and I had been following a lot of different blogs, from personal diaries to
tutorials on graphic design. I remember having Photoshop randomly installed on our computer and just making a lot of random
graphics like wallpapers, fake posters for bands that didn’t exist, pretty much anything. I learned a little bit about web design,
like HTML, CSS, and I decided I’d try to make my own blog, designing the theme and setting up the layout.<br><br>
<b>(1:50 Music interlude 3, “Trois Gnossiennes 3”)<br><br>
(1:58)</b><br>
After this I created a fan-centred blog on Tumblr, where I once again spent a lot of time creating and editing the theme
and other graphics, and where I would interact with fans by sharing our writing. Later, while in university I took the
course <i>Writing in Digital Cultures</i>, where we had to create a WordPress blog, which focused on my musical interests, and for
which I designed the logo and layout.<br><br>
<b>(2:19 Music interlude 4, “Throughput” from Blue Dot Sessions)<br><br>
(2:26)</b><br>
From all these experiences in digital authoring, I’ve come to realize that my interests in digital authorship revolve
mainly around design and learning how to create something that looks good. While I do enjoy writing, I also like to
balance it with creating graphics, and learning how to better present my own writing. At the moment, I’m learning how to
use Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop so that I can better express my interests in new and interesting ways. <br><br>

										<h2>Video Essay</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										In the video essay, I wanted to provide a visual representation of what my earliest digital authoring
										experiences looked like, to what they look like now. For this I used both screenshots of old blogging
										platforms and social media websites, along with video of me using an old version of Adobe Photoshop.
										The video then ends with me using Adobe InDesign CC, where a lot of my focus is now.

Music:</b> TwoPound by Blue Dot Sessions<br>
<b>Video:</b> Pictures of early digital authoring<br>
Throughout my time on the internet creating written and visual content, I’ve slowly come to realize what
actually makes me happy, and this is what I hope to explore in this video.<br><br>
<b>(00:00:08:18)<br>
Music:</b> Bossa Boa by Blue Dot Sessions<br>
<b>Video:</b> Using Photoshop<br>
Much of my earliest memories involved playing around on image editing software, creating fan-based graphics
for bands and books.<br><br>
<b>(00:00:17:18)<br>
Music:</b> Bossa Boa by Blue Dot Sessions<br>
<b>Video:</b> Making a new Blogger, pics of what it used to look like<br>
Around this time, I created a short-lived blog on Blogger, but actually maintaining the blog wasn’t as fun
as designing it.<br><br>
<b>(00:00:25:18)<br>
Music:</b> Trois Gnossiennes 3 by Blue Dot Sessions<br>
<b>Video:</b> Scrolling through WordPress blog posts<br>
I then took the course Writing in Digital Cultures, where we were tasked with creating blogs on WordPress.
Because of the limitations of the platform in the free version, the focus became the writing. This blog was
focused on music and alternative subcultures, and for this I reconnected with my love of research and writing.
I really enjoyed exploring my own personal interests in music and art and tying it in with article writing and
graphics. I wish I had more control over the actual look of the blog, but the main focus of the assignment
was the writing so I think it’s ok that I focused mainly on that.<br><br>
<b>(00:00:56:24)<br>
Music:</b> Throughput by Blue Dot Sessions<br>
<b>Video:</b> Scrolling through different InDesign projects<br>
After taking the Mechanics of Style course, I soon realized that my interests in creating graphics, album and
book covers was an actual thing, and I soon fell back in love with Photoshop but also with InDesign.<br><br>
<b>(00:01:06:23)<br>
Music:</b> Throughput by Blue Dot Sessions<br>
<b>Video:</b> Editing InDesign project<br>
Since then, I’ve been learning how to refine my design skills into creating various documents that reflect my
interests. From here I feel excited at the possibilities in terms of my career, but also just in having a
creative outlet along with writing that allows me explore different avenues of creation.<br><br>
